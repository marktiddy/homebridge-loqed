# Loqed Homebridge Plugin

</span>

This plugin has been created to allow you to integrate your Loqed Touch smart lock with homebridge including battery levels and a low battery level warning.

Please note: This plugin has not currently been tested with multiple LOQED devices but is setup to allow this functionality.

## Setting up this plugin

When you first add this plugin you will need to go to the [Loqed API Website](https://app.loqed.com), sign in with your Loqed username and password and click 'API' in the top menu.

### Create an API Key

At the bottom of this API page you can add a new API key. You will need to create one per Loqed Touch device you wish to add to Homebridge.

Make a note of the key, token and Local Key ID alongside the Lock ID.

### Create a Bridge Webhook

The webhook from the Loqed bridge allows us to get updates when the lock is unlocked or locked manually or via a service that isn't the Apple Home app.

Back on the API page find 'Outgoing Webhooks via LOQED Bridge' and click 'Add/Delete Webhooks'

On the new page create a new webook with the IP address of your Homebridge Raspberry Pi pointing to port 4567 /webhook. Tick all the boxes for trigger

e.g. http://192.168.4.79:4567/webhook

Finally, make a note of your Loqed device IP address at the top of this page (It is a good idea to give your Loqed Bridge a static API on your home network)

### Configuring Homebridge

Using the information created in the last step go back into Homebridge and click 'Settings' for the Homebridge Loqed plugin and add the details from above for each Loqed device you wish to add. The name field on the settings page is the name you wish the device to appear as by default in Homebridge and the Home app.
